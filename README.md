Breast cancer is a type of cancer that forms in the cells of the breasts. It can affect both men and women, though it is far more common in women.
There are several types of breast cancer, with the most common being:
Ductal Carcinoma In Situ (DCIS): A non-invasive cancer where abnormal cells are found in the lining of a breast duct.
Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC): The most common type, where cancer begins in the ducts and invades surrounding tissue.
Invasive Lobular Carcinoma (ILC): Cancer that starts in the lobules (milk-producing glands) and can spread to nearby tissues.
Symptoms:
Common signs and symptoms of breast cancer include:
A lump or mass in the breast or underarm area.
Changes in the size or shape of the breast.
Unexplained pain in the breast or nipple.
Changes in the appearance or texture of the breast skin or nipple.
Diagnosis:
Early detection is crucial for successful treatment. Diagnostic methods include:
Mammograms: Regular screenings can help detect breast cancer early, even before symptoms appear.
Ultrasound: Often used to examine a lump found during a physical exam or mammogram.
Biopsy: The definitive way to diagnose breast cancer, where a sample of breast tissue is examined for cancer cells.
Supervised Learning
Supervised learning is a fundamental machine learning paradigm where an algorithm is trained on labeled data. This means that each training example is paired with an output label, allowing the model to learn the relationship between input features and the corresponding outputs.
Key Features
Training Data: A dataset consisting of input-output pairs used to train the model. The inputs are typically features or attributes, while the outputs are the labels or targets.
Model: An algorithm that learns from the training data to make predictions or classifications. Common models include linear regression, decision trees, support vector machines, and neural networks.
Loss Function: A metric used to evaluate how well the model's predictions match the actual labels. The goal of training is to minimize this loss function.
Evaluation Metrics: Metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are used to assess the performance of the trained model on unseen data.
