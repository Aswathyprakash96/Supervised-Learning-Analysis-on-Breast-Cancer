Breast cancer is a type of cancer that forms in the cells of the breasts. It can affect both men and women, though it is far more common in women.
There are several types of breast cancer, with the most common being:
Ductal Carcinoma In Situ (DCIS): A non-invasive cancer where abnormal cells are found in the lining of a breast duct.
Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC): The most common type, where cancer begins in the ducts and invades surrounding tissue.
Invasive Lobular Carcinoma (ILC): Cancer that starts in the lobules (milk-producing glands) and can spread to nearby tissues.
Symptoms:
Common signs and symptoms of breast cancer include:
A lump or mass in the breast or underarm area.
Changes in the size or shape of the breast.
Unexplained pain in the breast or nipple.
Changes in the appearance or texture of the breast skin or nipple.
